# Awesome Transcription [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of speech-to-text tools — desktop apps, APIs, open-source models, and services for turning audio and video into usable text.

Whisper changed what transcription costs and what it can do. This list covers the local apps built on top of it, the hosted APIs that scale past a laptop, the open-source models underneath, and the editor-first tools that treat the transcript as the timeline.
